Red Hat AAP2 Components:

1. Ansible Core:
	yum install ansible-core -y
   ansible.builtin  Modules: provide bare minumum modules, plugins and key functions such as loops, conditionals

	Ealier version upto 2.9, All modules were provided by RedHat. version of Modules was also problem. 
	cisco device: IOS 1.1    IOS 1.12  IOS 2.2  

	ALL Ansible Modules	=	Ansible Core (RedHat) + Other Specific Modules (Vendor Cisco,MYsql, MS, VMWare, Juniper) 

2. Ansible Content Collections:

Ansible Collection = Modules + Plugins + Roles
Ansible Content Collections made up of related modules, roles, and plug-ins for specific product with specific version (Device, OS etc )that are supported by the same group of developers. It provide flexibility to select different versions of collections for different version of Product( OS/Device)
Collection Name
Company.ProductName


3. Automation Content Navigator ( ansible-navigator )
   This tool replaces and extends the functionality of several older command-line utilities
   yum install ansible-navigator -y 
  ansible-config		ansible-navigator config
  ansible-inventory		ansible-navigator inventory
  ansible-playbook		ansible-navigator run
  ansible-doc			ansible-navigator doc 
  ansible-lint			ansible-navigator lint

  It separates the control node on which you run Ansible from the automation execution environment that runs it, by running your playbooks in a container. 
  watch podman ps 

4. Automation Execution Environments
   An automation execution environment is a container image that contains Ansible Core (ansible.builtin collection), Ansible Content Collections, and any Python libraries, executables, or other dependencies needed to run your playbook
  Container images can be downloaded from RedHat or custom build( ansible-builder)
  Playbooks can be run on Automation Controller (formerly called Red Hat Ansible Tower) using Container Image
  ansible-builder to create your own custom execution environments

5. Automation Controller (Red Hat Ansible Tower or AWX community)
   Used to run ansible playbook on Enterprise scale. It provides a web UI and a REST API that can be used to configure, run, and evaluate your automation jobs.
   The new automation controller design separate the control node (providing the web UI and API) from the automation execution environments (now running
in containers).
   
6. Ansible Automation Hub
   Place to distribute Ansible Collections and Container image registry for automation execution environments.
   Ansible AUtomation Hub is provided by Redhat/Ansible Galaxy or can be Private Automation Hub within Organization
   Hub 2 Types: 
   	1. RedHat Hub
   	2. Private Hub
	HUB = Collections (Roles, Modules, Plugins) + Images (ansible-core, Python, Collection which user needed)
	
7. Hosted Services

   Red Hat Insights:  Keep checking Remote Systems to Understand automation code you are running and whether it is successful
   Automation Services Catalog: Allow nontechnical users to trigger automation with a point-and-click tool based on ITSM standards


Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform =  Automation HUB (Collections , Images ) + Ansible Controller (Tower) + ansible-navigator



Chapter 2:


Inventory:

	Default File:	/etc/ansible/hosts
	Custom File:	YOUR_CUSTOM_PATH

Inventory groups:
all, ungrouped as system/ansible defined default groups
Rest are CUSTOM NAMED groups












Running Playbooks with Automation Content Navigator:

Old Way:
	This runs playbook on control node
	ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
New Way:
	This runs playbook on Container using Image (ansible runner)
	Interactive:
	ansible-navigator run playbook.yml -i inventory 
	## Go to specfic section by pressing :NUMBER
		
	Non Interactive:
	ansible-navigator run playbook.yml -i inventory -m stdout


Installation and subscription:




subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-ansible-2-rpms
yum install ansible

		Modules						Plugin
		python						python
		make changes to Managed Host			Support System to ansible


Documentation:

## To see all Modules

	ansible-doc -l   

## Folder for python Modules

ls -l /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/

Module is a python script(Module) which will do activity(Changes) on Managed Hosts

Ansible Modules get copied from Control Node to Managed Hosts and make changes
Ansible Plugins doesn't get copied, this is for support services , NO changes made by Plugin on Managed Host

Plugins: Mostly Support Services

Anything NOT available as module, is available as Plugin. Plugin provides Support Infrastructure
ansible-doc -t SOMETHING_STUPID -l //to see all plugins
ansible-doc -t connection -l

ansible-doc -t connection network_cli

ansible-doc -t inventory -l


Ansible File and Data Formats
It helps to be familiar with the file and data formats used by Ansible. Here is a list of formats,
broken down with sublists describing where each format is used:
• INI format
– The Ansible configuration file, ansible.cfg
– Inventory files (inventory files may also use YAML format)
• YAML
– Playbook files
– Inventory files, optionally
– Other included files, such as role files
• JSON
– The ansible-playbook program returns variable data in JSON form



INI or YAML format:


	INI Format:
vim inventory

[spines]
spine01
spine02

[leafs]
leaf[01:08]

[ip_range]
192.168.1.[1:20]

ansible-inventory shows you how finl variable and system at the of execution of playbook:

ansible-inventory --list	//JSON format
ansible-inventory --graph
ansible-inventory --graph group
ansible-inventory --host host
ansible-inventory --list --yaml -i INI_inventory_file

ansible -i inventory --list-hosts spine*

ansible 192.168.[/2-3].[/4-8] --list-hosts -i invenotry_file_path

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33363023/is-there-any-option-to-list-groups-in-ansible#:~:text=If%20you%20just%20want%20a,the%20names%20of%20the%20groups.






Ansible configuration File:

ansible --version

	Chapter 3:
Ansible Config Scope: in ansible.cfg/command line inbuild ansible paramters

	## 	Variable Scope:		##
	
Role Scope:	In roles structure (defaults/main.yml and vars/main.yml)
Host Scope:	Inventory where hosts are defined (inventory file/dir, group_vars, host_vars)
Play Scope:	In Playbook
Global Scope:	Command Line  OR RUN Time

		Scope of Variables:
ROLE Scope < Host Scope (Inventory Level) <  Play Scope  < Global Scope


1.	Host Scope		// Inventory File , group_vars, host_vars

	A.	Group_inventory: 		inventory File_ group variable		use = symbol (if using ini format inventory)
											[groupname:vars]
											var1="somevalue"
		
	B.	Group_group_vars_folder: 	group_vars/{{groupname}}(.yml)		use : symbol
			
	C.	host inventory variable		use = symbol
	D.	host_vars folder		host_vars/{{servername}}.yml		use : symbol


2. 	Play Scope (Playbook)
	A.	vars:
	B. 	Vars_Prompt:	// prompt user to enter value //Interactive // Good for Development Env
		
	C.	vars_files:
		- file_path
		
	D:	Task Scope:
		vars:
		  variable_name: "Value"  ## For that Specific Task
	E. 	Set Fact
			set_fact:
			  var1: "Some value you want to override"	
3.	Global Scope (Command Line Values)
	A.	ansible-playbook abc.yml -e 'var_name=some_value var2=someValue2 var3=someValue3' 

//Share Inventory Variables

Dev 		Test		QA		Prod

//No Share/Not Same Values
vars_files:

DICT Reverse Traverse by Defulat //Question


Facts:
System value is known as FACT
setup.py is default module for gathering facts
setup module is used for Linux (little bit for windows)
vyos_facts
ios_facts

setup module is default to collect facts works for Linux, somewhat for windows NOT for Network/others


loops started from Ansible 2.5, before was 'with_*'

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/utils/docsite/filters_ipaddr.html



	Chapter 4:
	
	
	

ansible --version > ansible.cfg(inventory) -> ansible-inventory -> convert inventory(combine static files[ini,yaml]), group_vars(inventory,playbook),host_vars(inventory,playbook) into format that playbook/Ad-Hoc understand -> then playbook/Ad-Hoc runs


ansible-inventory is NOT for converting ini to yaml, purpose is: how the final inventory look like with all its final variable values Before running playbook, ansible-inventory  runs, create Final inventory and feeds it to playbook/Ad-Hoc to run on it.

ansible or ansible-playbook requires inventory. Lot of variables/Lots os scripts

Final Runtime Env/hosts presented, if you want to see ansible-inventory to see final host with variables

Dynamic Inventory:

Active Directory, Cobbler, Redhat Satellite, VMWare, VirtualBox, Openstack, Openshift
Scripts are written in Python normally but another language like  bash is also OK 


https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/stable-2.9/contrib/inventory

Executable Script with [chmod +x script] (Mostly Python, but can be in diffude or import task files.erent Language as well)

Free			Paid Support








## Chapter 3:


Ansible Tower/controller is paid (AWX free community) is only for executing playbook not write a playbook 

Run a Job:		
1. Organization 
2. Inventory and Group/Host Variables
	A. Whole Inventory
	B. For a specific Group
	C. For a specific Host
3. Playbook Folder(Manual Copy/Git SCM) on Tower	:	Copy Playbooks from workstation to Tower Machine
4. Change permission to chown -R awx:awx /var/lib/awx/projects/your_folder for Manual Copy (Git will have right perm automatically)
5. Project maps to your_playbook_folder (Project <-> one_folder) One to one Mapping
6. Credentials 
7. Job Template (Run a playbook using inventory,credentials and some other settings)
8. RBAC User (Role Based Access Control) 

Vars_Prompt is NOT compatible with tower, so SURVEY needs to be used

Ansible
1. Nginx 		GUIude or import task files.
2. RabbitMQ		Messaging
3. Database		postgres
4. supervisorctl





## Chapter 6 ##

Import (import_tasks, import_role)
static inclusion of tasks(you know tasks in advance)
ansible-playbook abc.yml --syntax-check    ## also check syntax of imported Task file
4  task in external file ## Condition checked on all task one by one although condition is false
--start-at-task can be used to start execution of playbook at certain point
Might take more time
for Development Environment
Can not use loop for importing Task files

include (include_tasks, include_role)
Dynamic inclusion of tasks(you DO NOT know tasks in advance)
ansible-playbook abc.yml --syntax-check    ## DOES NOT check syntax of included Task file
4  task in external file ## Condition checked only once, if false file tasks are not included in execution of playbook
--start-at-task doesn't work as task names are NOT known in advance
Time efficient
for Production Environment
Use loop for Including Task files



Roles:

Reusability for a purpose

Playbook: 30 tasks,variables: values,Inventory Hosts,

Var: values	// sensitive data
hosts: 		// exposing inventory
30 tasks	// 10 tasks

	Roles:
reusability
roles based on purpose: httpd php VYOS_NETWORK juniper_user  ios_user mysql  postgresql

web_server
network-security
Find_all_devices -> Prerequisites -> Networking -> Web server -> Security -> Inform_Stake_Holders

Roles:

defaults: 	define variables in main.yml
vars:		define variables in main.yml but highter priority than defaults
tasks:		TASK file, write tasks in main.yml 
handlers:	define handlers in main.yml which will be invoked by tasks in main.yml
meta:		Define Dependency roles

8. extra handlers involved by tasks in playbook 		use_roles.yml handlers section  
9. Post  Tasks							post_tasks/		
10. Post  Handlers						post_tasks/notified -> handlers









role defaults (defined in role/defaults/main.yml) 1


Can loop for importing files

## Chapter 7:


Forks vs Serial:
(CI/CD Implementation)


	forks										serial
1.	ansible.cfg(default 5)								playbook
	ansible-plabyook a.yml --forks=4
2.	Manage number of threads/load							control no of systems updating at same time
	 on control node/container (save Control Node)
	 per fork=100MB for Tower
3.	task by task									host by host/play by play


The serial keyword can also be specified as a percentage, which will be applied to the total number of hosts in a play, in order to determine the number of hosts per pass:

Strategy:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.html

	T3	10,10,5
	T4	10,10,5
	

Actual RAM requirements vary based on how many hosts Tower will manage simultaneously (which is controlled by the forks parameter in the job template or the system ansible.cfg file). To avoid possible resource conflicts, Ansible recommends 4 GB of memory per 100 forks. For example, if forks is set to 100, 4 GB of memory is recommended; if forks is set to 400, 16 GB of memory is recommended.
1 GB of memory per 10 forks OR 100MB per fork
